## Project Overview

**heala** is an AI-powered personal health record platform designed for Sri Lanka and similar developing countries.  
It provides:

- **React Native Mobile App** for patients  
- **Web Dashboard** for doctors, hospitals, and pharmaceutical companies  
- **Node.js Backend** with **PostgreSQL** database  
- **Azure Cloud Integration** for secure, scalable storage  

The platform digitizes prescriptions, analyzes medicines, summarizes lab reports, and provides actionable health insights for patients while offering analytics to healthcare stakeholders.

---

## Problem Statement

- Handwritten prescriptions are **difficult to track digitally**.  
- Patients lack **unified digital health records** across hospitals, clinics, and labs.  
- Lab reports are **full of medical jargon**, making it hard for patients to understand their results.  
- Governments, pharma, and equipment providers lack **real-time insights** on disease trends and medicine usage.

---

## Solution

heala Provides a **Mobile + Web + Cloud-Based Platform**:

### 1. Prescription Digitization & Analysis
- Upload handwritten prescriptions via mobile app.  
- AI/ML (OCR + NLP) converts them into structured data: medicine name, dosage, duration, diagnosis.  
- AI analyzes **medicine purpose, timing, usage, and precautions**.  
- Validates against a **local drug database**.

### 2. Lab Report Summarization & Guidance
- Upload lab reports (PDF or image).  
- AI extracts results, **summarizes findings in simple language**.  
- Provides actionable guidance:
  - Dos and donâ€™ts  
  - Diet and lifestyle recommendations  
  - Alerts on critical values

### 3. Patient Health Record
- Builds **longitudinal health history**:
  - Past illnesses & diagnoses  
  - Medicines consumed (brand + generic)  
  - Lab tests & summarized reports  
- Accessible anytime, even if patients change doctors or hospitals.

### 4. Web Dashboard for Stakeholders
- **Doctors:** view patient history, prescribe digitally, monitor trends  
- **Pharma Companies:** understand prescription patterns, drug demand, and market insights  
- **Hospitals & Labs:** monitor test trends and patient outcomes

### 5. Analytics for Stakeholders
- **Government:** outbreak monitoring, medicine shortages, health trends  
- **Pharma & Medical Equipment Providers:** demand insights, prescription patterns, high-demand diagnostics/tests

---

## Technology Stack

- **Mobile App:** React Native (cross-platform for iOS & Android)  
- **Web Dashboard:** React.js / Next.js for doctors & pharma companies  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (relational, secure, scalable)  
- **Cloud:** Azure (data storage, authentication, deployment)  
- **AI/ML:** OCR + NLP for prescriptions, lab report summarization models  
- **Security:** Encrypted data storage, HIPAA-like compliance
