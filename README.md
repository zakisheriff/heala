**Heala** is an **AI-powered personal health record platform** designed for Sri Lanka (and similar developing countries). It digitizes handwritten prescriptions, creates a unified patient health record, and provides analytics to stakeholders such as governments, pharma companies, and medical equipment providers.

## 🌟 Problem Statement

- Most medical prescriptions are **handwritten**, making them hard to track digitally.  
- Patients lack a **unified digital health record** across hospitals, clinics, and labs.  
- Governments, pharma companies, and equipment providers lack **real-time insights** on disease trends, medicine usage, and healthcare demands.  
- Patients struggle to track **past illnesses, lab results, and prescribed medicines**.

---

## 💡 Solution

Heala provides a **mobile + cloud-based platform** that:

### 1. Digitizes Prescriptions
- Patients upload photos of handwritten prescriptions.  
- AI/ML (OCR + NLP trained on local handwriting) converts them into structured data: medicine name, dosage, duration, diagnosis.  
- Data is validated against a **local drug database** to correct spelling and confirm availability.  

### 2. Patient Health Record
- Builds a **longitudinal health history** including:
  - Past illnesses and diagnoses
  - Medicines consumed (brand + generic)
  - Lab tests and reports (uploaded via photo/PDF, AI extracts values)  
- Records are **accessible anytime**, even if patients change doctors or hospitals.

### 3. Analytics for Stakeholders
- **Government:** track outbreaks, medicine shortages, health trends.  
- **Pharma companies:** understand demand, prescription patterns, generic vs. brand usage.  
- **Medical equipment providers:** monitor which diagnostics/tests are in high demand.

## 🏗 Phased Approach

1. **Phase 1:** Prescription digitization & medicine tracking.  
2. **Phase 2:** Lab report ingestion with AI extraction.  
3. **Phase 3:** API integration with hospitals, clinics, and labs (WSO2 for interoperability).  
4. **Phase 4:** Predictive insights — early detection of chronic conditions.

## 💰 Revenue Streams

1. **B2B:**  
   - Hospital/clinic subscriptions to access patient history (with consent)  
   - Pharma companies pay for anonymized insights  
   - Insurance providers pay for verified medical histories  

2. **B2C:**  
   - Premium patient app features (medicine reminders, digital prescriptions)  
   - Subscription for unlimited storage of reports and health data  

3. **Government/Public Health:**
